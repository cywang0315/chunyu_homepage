    "text": "I’m a PhD candidate in Colin Beier’s lab, working on new tools to make complex, broad-scale systems easier for humans to understand. Right now, that means I split my time between predictive modeling (to monitor forest carbon sequestration across New York State, track the development of early-successional forests, and more) and visualization (including using game engines as a GIS and making it easier to make reproducible VR environments for research). By training I’m either an ecologist (specializing in landscape and translational ecology) or environmental scientist; professionally, I’ve worked as a data analyst, software engineer, and chicken farmer.\nOn this site I keep a list of my publications, presentations, and my CV, as well as a technical blog."
